## Features

FolderStyle is a small application that's capable of generating hierarchical file listings by taking into account a wide range of filters.

Based on a single window that provides direct access to all available options, the interface is user-friendly. You can get started by selecting the drive or directory whose file contents you want to take into account for the listing, as well as pick the report style, such as a brief and printable HTML report, or Windows Media Player style playlist.

It's possible to compile information only for applications, archives, audio tracks, images, Office documents, or videos. FolderStyle lets you filter files by format, set a minimum and maximum size, as well as specify ranges when it comes to the date of creation, last modification and last access.

Empty folders can be hidden from display. What's more, you can sort the objects by name, size, creation, last modification or last accessed time, or scrambled, while the order can be reversed. The file name case can remain unchanged or get converted to lowercase or uppercase.

Profiles can be saved to file and later imported, which means that you can create multiple profiles with different settings. Once the task is completed, FolderStyle shows the new report in a text document that you can either save or dismiss.
